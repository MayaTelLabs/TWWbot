Lets you post images to twitter in a consecutive fashion. Highly modified (and updated) version of Spacebruce's MonogotariBot.

Requires latest versions of python3 and tweepy (which can be acquired via pip). Also requires consumer and access keys, plus their respective secrets, from Twitter's Developer Portal.

Otherwise, pretty self-explanatory and self-sufficient. Should work with any mainstream image filetype, although is currently set to only look for jpeg files. Just change the extension on line 78.

This is a personal project, and the first functional bit of code I've ever glued together. No warranties, no refunds.
